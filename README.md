# CS-320 Software Testing

<li>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</li>
</br>
<p>Ensuring that my code is both functional and secure requires a combination of the best practices, thorough testing, and ongoing vigilance. The best practice is to follow the software development life cycle. This cycle involves 6 stages:
  <ol>
    <li>Planning - clearly defining the functional requirements of my software, understanding the purpose, features, user expectation all help build a strong foundation for the development process.</li>
    <li>Design - creating a solid architecture and design for my software will help save potential drawbacks with implementation, considering factors like scalability and maintainability.</li>
    <li>Implementation - following the best coding practices such as proper user validation and other secure coding guidelines, enforcing readability to allow smooth peer edits, considering reusability and scalability will ensure my software is functional and secure.</li>
    <li>Testing and Integration - thorough testing is essential for both functionality and security, including all unit testing, integration testing, system testing, regression testing, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and dynamic application security testing.</li>
    <li>Deployment - user acceptance testing needs to also be completed in the development stage in order to completely sign off everything</li>
    <li>Maintenance - as technology advances, languages used in projects also advance, therefore projects need to be updated and maintained regularly in order to stay functional.</li>
  </ol>
  
</p>
</br>
<li>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</li>
</br>
<p>Interpreting user needs and incorperating them into a program is a critical aspect of software development to ensure that the final product meets user expectations. There are many different ways to go about achieving this:
  <ul>
    <li>Gather all requirements - engage with users to gather detailed requirements with things such as interviews, surveys, workshops, etc.</li>
    <li>Create User Stories - "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"</li>
    <li>Define Acceptance Criteria - define clear acceptance criteria that outlines what must be met for the story to be considered complete.</li>
    <li>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) - have users test the software against their needs allowing them to use the software and provide feedback.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
</br>
<li>How do I approach designing software?</li>
</br>
<p>Designing software involves creating a plan that outlines how the software will meet its intended purpose while considering factors like user needs, functionality, performance, scalability, and maintainability. I would approach it by:
  <ol>
    <li>First understanding the problem which is arguably the most important step</li>
    <li>Define objectives</li>
    <li>Architectural design</li>
    <li>Functional desig</li>
    <li>User interface (UI) and design (UX)</li>
    <li>Data desig</li>
    <li>Performance</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Error handling</li>
    <li>Testing strategies</li>
    <li>Documentation</li>
  </ol>
</p>
